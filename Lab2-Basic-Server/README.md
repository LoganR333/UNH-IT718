# Deploy a Basic Server Lab
## Objectives
For each of the three major cloud vendors (AWS, Azure, and GCP) complete the following actions:
1.	Use the command shell to deploy a server running nginx.
2.	Retrieve IP address from console.
3.	Verify running web page.
4.	In he console terminate the running instance.
### Comments about this lab
- There are many, many, ways to deploy a server to the cloud.  This is true for every cloud vendor.  As discussed in class it is easy to follow some web-based wizard and in a few clicks have a running server.
- This lab focuses on the API calls needed for a server deployment.
- In the real-world, deployments abstract away the cloud provider's API into templates, scripts, CI/CD processes.
- Deploying a server requires supporting infrastructure:  networking (VPC, subnets), security (keys, security groups) are common examples.
- The provided scripts assume the basic infrastructure needs to be created.  It is also assumed that you would like to keep the infrastructure created for later labs.
**BEFORE JUST BLINDLY CUTTING & PASTING:**
Should you alter the scripts to use existing infrastructure?
Do you want to keep any created resources?  More meaningful names should be considered.
Do you know what resources you will pay for?  Leaving unused compute running is a bad idea.
The scripts in these labs do not clean up after themselves.
## Lab Report
Provide one or screenshots for each cloud vendor showing:
1.	The output from the command showing the VM IP addresses.
2.	wget/curl command retrieving the nginx default page,
3.	Successful SSH login.
