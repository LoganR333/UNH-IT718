# Database Session

> [!NOTE]
> This lab only needs to be completed using AWS.

You will deploy an AWS Lambda function written in python (code provided).
The function takes two http get requests:
- /new?email=testmail.com
- /get?email=testmail.com&uuid=uuid-value

/new generates, stores, and returns a uuid as a cookie.  Multiple calls to /new will update the uuid value.  
/get validates the UUID against the stored value.  

The ?mail query parameter value is *NOT* checked for validity.  We will leave that for the next lab.
